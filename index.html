        <h2 class="story">MY STORY</h2>
        <P class="starts">It all started when i was in the school say 5th grade, in my art class we all students got a homework to draw something on the drawing book we were given a big horizontal book as a drawing book, so i remeber this story because that is when nobody belived that i drew the thing and the thing i grew was 'Mickey Mouse'It was not like i drew it blindly i did copy it but i did'nt trace the thing because it was on my pencil box and as i told you before my art book was a big book so still people did'nt belive it was me and also my sister was and is a brilliant minded human so everyone thought she did the work bit i can tell till date she has not done any of my single homework, So the teacher called her to our class and asked if she drew the drawing and she said no but still they did'nt belive me that is when i got to know that i can draw. </P>
        
        <p class="starts">Later on when i joined engineering college i started drawing again but unfortunatly i dont have the mickey mouse drawing.</p>
        <p class="starts">But this time i started recording my arts i thought i will post this stuff in youtube</p>
        <p class="starts">That is when i started posting my arts on instagram i also uploaded the video on youtube but not all of them</p>
